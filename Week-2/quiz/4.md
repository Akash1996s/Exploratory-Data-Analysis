<b>Question:</b>
```
The following code does NOT result in a plot appearing on the screen device.
```
```R
library(lattice)
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | factor(Month), data = airquality)
```
```
Which of the following is an explanation for why no plot appears?

(i) The variables being plotted are not found in that dataset.
(ii) The object 'p' has not yet been printed with the appropriate print method.
(iii) There is a syntax error in the call to xyplot().
(iv) The xyplot() function, by default, sends plots to the PDF device.
```
<b>Solution:</b>
```R
> library(lattice)
> library(datasets)
> data(airquality)
> p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | factor(Month),data=airquality)
> ## The object 'p' has not yet been printed with the appropriate print method.
