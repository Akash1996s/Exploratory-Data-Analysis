<b>Question:</b>
```
When I run the following code I get an error:
```
```R
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(movies, aes(votes, rating))
print(g)
```
```
I was expecting a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' to appear. 
What's the problem?

(i) There is a syntax error in the call to ggplot.
(ii) The dataset is too large and hence cannot be plotted to the screen.
(iii) The object 'g' does not have a print method.
(iv) ggplot does not yet know what type of layer to add to the plot.
```
<b>Solution:</b>
```R
> library(ggplot2)
> ig <- ggplot(movies,aes(votes,rating))
> print(ig)
Error: No layers in plot
## ggplot does not yet know what type of layer to add to the plot
```
