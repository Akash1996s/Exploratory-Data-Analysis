<b>Question:</b>
```
The following code creates a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' from the movies dataset in the ggplot2 package. 

After loading the ggplot2 package with the library() function, I can run
```
```R
qplot(votes, rating, data = movies)
```
```R
How can I modify the the code above to add a smoother to the scatterplot?

(i) qplot(votes, rating, data = movies) + geom_smooth()
(ii) qplot(votes, rating, data = movies) + stats_smooth("loess")
(iii) qplot(votes, rating, data = movies, smooth = "loess")
(iv) qplot(votes, rating, data = movies, panel = panel.loess)
```
