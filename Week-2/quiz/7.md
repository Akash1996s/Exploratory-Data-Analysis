<b>Question:</b>
```
Load the `airquality' dataset form the datasets package in R.
```
```R
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
```
```R
I am interested in examining how the relationship between ozone and wind speed varies across each month. 

What would be the appropriate code to visualize that using ggplot2?

(i) qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ factor(Month))
 
(ii) airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ Month)
 
(iii) qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality)
 
(iv) qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, geom = "smooth")
```
<b>Solution:</b>
```R
> library(datasets)
> data(airquality)
> airquality=transform(airquality,Month=factor(Month))
> qplot(Wind,Ozone,data=airquality,facets=.~Month)
Error: could not find function "qplot"
> library(ggplot2)
> qplot(Wind,Ozone,data=airquality,facets=.~Month)
```
