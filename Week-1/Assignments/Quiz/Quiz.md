(iii) Plots are created and annotated with separate functions
(iv) Margins and spacings are adjusted automatically depending on the type of plot and the data

Solution:
(iii) Plots are created and annotated with separate functions

```

```
```
Question 9

What does the 'pch' option to par() control?

(i) the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
(ii) the size of the plotting symbol in a scatterplot
(iii) the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system
(iv) the line width in the base graphics system

Solution:
(iii) the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system

```
```
Question 10

If I want to save a plot to a PDF file, 
which of the following is a correct way of doing that?

(i) Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()
(ii) Construct the plot on the PNG device with png(), then copy it to a PDF with dev.copy2pdf().
(iii) Open the screen device with quartz(), construct the plot, and then close the device with dev.off().
(iv) Open the PostScript device with postscript(), construct the plot, then close the device with dev.off().

Solution:
(i) Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()

```
